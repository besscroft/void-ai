# Void AI

A local-first AI desktop workspace built with Electron, React, AI SDK, Hono, SQLite, Drizzle and HeroUI.

Void AI is being shaped as more than a chat client. The desktop app now has first-class surfaces for Agents, Workflows, Harness, Memory, Server, interaction profiles and sync state. It can run locally without a self-hosted cloud server, while leaving a clear path for optional encrypted sync and a future Web client.

See [docs/architecture.md](docs/architecture.md) for the full product and technical design.
