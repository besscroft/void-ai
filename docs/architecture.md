# Void AI Architecture

Void AI uses one execution model for chat, automations, skills, and child agents: an outer
`AgentLoopSessionManager` owns the run while the AI SDK `ToolLoopAgent` performs one ReAct step at
a time.

## Runtime

Each `AgentLoopSession` owns a `runId`, an abort signal, the coordinator and runtime recorder,
budget counters, and two persisted FIFO input queues. User messages are `steering`; internal
automation, tool, and system messages are `follow_up`. After a step, steering is consumed first,
then follow-up. A run ends naturally only when the model has no tool calls and both queues are
empty.

Root defaults are eight turns, 50 tool calls, and ten minutes. When a budget is exhausted, tools
are disabled for one final response and a `budget` event is recorded. Approval pauses retain the
same `runId`; cancellation, errors, aborts, and application shutdown are hard stops. Startup marks
unfinished runs `interrupted` and discards queued inputs without replaying side effects.

`RunToolScheduler` allows known read-only tools to execute concurrently and serializes writes to
memory, the sandbox, settings, and automations. A cancelled run never starts a queued side effect.

## Persistence

`runtime_runs` stores origin, status, finish reason, usage, and the final summary. `agent_run_inputs`
stores the input kind, source, JSON message, sequence, lifecycle status, and discard reason. The
`(run_id, status, sequence)` index provides FIFO reads. Runtime events use `agent`, `loop_input`,
`skill`, `budget`, `tool`, and diagnostic kinds.

The development database is intentionally greenfield. The initial Drizzle migration contains no
legacy execution tables or compatibility columns.

## Boundaries

Agents own identity, model policy, handoff policy, memory, and tool selection. Skills provide
instructions, input schema, configuration, trigger words, and approval policy. Activating a skill
returns structured instructions; the session decides subsequent tools, handoffs, memory writes,
and stopping.

Chat sends `POST /api/chat` with `runId` and `mode` (`start` or `resume`). During an active run the
renderer sends `runtime.enqueueInput` and keeps the message editable. `runtime.cancelRun` aborts
the same session. Model, reasoning, and tool settings are captured at run start and apply to the
next run only.

## Recovery

The main process interrupts active sessions before closing. On the next startup, persisted active
runs become `interrupted` and queued inputs become `discarded`. The content and diagnostics remain
available for inspection, but no model call or tool side effect is replayed automatically.
